This Progressive Web App (PWA) developed as a simple project for MSc degree and allows users to manage and display the informations of tennis players. Users can fill out a form with the player's details and, upon submission, view a dynamically generated profile with the player's stats. The app uses local storage to maintain data persistence and supports offline functionality. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Entry**: Fill out a form to input informations of a tennis player.
- **Local Storage**: Data is stored locally in the browser, enabling offline functionality and ensuring data persistence between sessions.
- **Profile Generation**: Automatically generates a profile displaying the player's stats upon form submission.
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable on devices, providing a native app-like experience and offline capabilities.

## User Flow

1. **Form Submission**:
   - Users fill out a form with the necessary details about a tennis player (e.g., name, age, ranking, coach, etc.).
   - On submission, the data is stored in the browser's local storage.

2. **Profile Display**:
   - The app retrieves the stored data and dynamically generates a profile page displaying the player's stats.
   - Users can view and possibly edit the stats at any time.

3. **Viewing Existing Player Stats**:
   - To view the stats of a player that has already been assigned, users need to enter the player's name in the starting field of the form.
   - The app will fetch and display the stored stats for the player with the entered name.
